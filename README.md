# Corona

## Deprecated

This library supports tokio 0.1, which is outdated. There's not much need for it
any more since Rust supports native async/await syntax. Use some of the async
libraries directly.

## About the library

[![Travis Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/vorner/corona.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vorner/corona)

When you need to get the asynchronous out of the way.

Corona is a library providing stackful coroutines for Rust. They integrate well
with futures â€’ it is possible to switch between the abstractions as needed, each
coroutine is also a future and a coroutine can wait for a future to complete.
Furthermore, the futures don't have to be `'static`.

On the other hand, there's a runtime cost to the library. The performance does
not necessarily suffer (as seen in the
[benchmarks](https://vorner.github.io/async-bench.html)). But each coroutine has
its own stack, which takes memory.

You want to read the [docs](https://docs.rs/corona) and examine the
[examples](https://github.com/vorner/corona/tree/master/examples).
